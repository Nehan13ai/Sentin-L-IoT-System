# ?? Sentin-L: Industrial IoT Predictive Maintenance System

## ?? Project Overview
Sentin-L is a **C-based Industrial IoT Simulation** designed to monitor factory machinery in real-time. It mimics a predictive maintenance system used in Industry 4.0 standards.

## ?? Key Features
* **IoT Simulation:** Generates realistic sensor data (Temperature & Vibration).
* **AI Analytics Engine:** Uses Linear Regression to predict **Time-to-Failure** (TTF).
* **Intelligent Alerting:** Triggers emergency shutdown protocols.
* **Autonomous Logic:** Runs independently until safety thresholds are breached.

## ??? Technical Implementation
* **Language:** C
* **Logic:** Linear Regression
* **System:** Real-time polling loop.

## ?? How to Run
1.  **Compile:** \gcc main.c -o sentin_l\
2.  **Run:** \./sentin_l\
